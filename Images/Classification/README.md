## LRN in ResNet
This is the implementation of LRN in ResNet architectures. The training and evaluation framework was adapted from [ Fully Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision](https://github.com/kschwethelm/HyperbolicCV}).
The **LRN** contains our implementation of LRN used in a hyperbolic ResNet architecture. We provide an example usage in the **example** folder. To run our code, please run 

```
bash example/example.sh
```
