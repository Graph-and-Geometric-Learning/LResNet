## LResNet in GNN - Heterophilic Graphs
We provide our implementation of LResNet as the residual connection in a GNN architecture trained on hetrophilic graph datasets in the *lrn.py* file. We provide examples of how to use our code in the **example** folder. For the GNN architecture, run
```
bash example/gnn_example.sh
```
## LResNet in Graph Transformers
We provide our implementation of LLResNetRN in a graph transformer architecture in *hyp_transformer.py*. To run our code, please run
```
bash example/transformer_example.sh
```
The code is adapted from [*SGFormer: Simplifying and Empowering Transformers for Large-Graph Representations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10759).
