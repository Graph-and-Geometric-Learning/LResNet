# Lorentzian-Residual-Neural-Networks

This repo contains the implementation for the paper "Lorentzian Residual Neural Networks" to be presented at KDD 2025. 

## Requirements

## Organization
* For our implementation on homophilous graphs for LResNet in GNN, see the **homophilous** folder. 
* For the implementation of LResNet in GNN on heterophilic graphs and LResNet in graph transformer, see the **hetrophilic** folder. 
* For LResNet in hyperbolic ResNet for image classification, see the **Classification** folder in **Images**. 
* For OOD robutness of LResNet, see the **OOD-Detection** folder in **Images**.
* In each of the above foler, we provide an **example** foler that include examples of running our code with sensible hyperparameters. Please see each folder for more details.
